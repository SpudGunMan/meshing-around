Random Mesh Scripts for BBS activities for use with Meshtastic nodes

## pong-bot.sh
![alt text](etc/pong-bot.jpg "Example Use")

Little bot which will trap keywords like ping and respond on a DM with pong. The script will also monitor the group channels for keywords to trap on. you can also `Ping @Data to Echo` as a example for further processing.

- `lheard` returns the last 5 heard nodes with SNR, can also use `sitrep`
- `cmd` returns the list of commands (the help message)

## mesh-bot.sh

 alternate bot, adds internet and other telemetry data which goes beyond just ping

- Various solar details for radio propagation
  - `sun` and `moon` return info on rise and set local time
  - `solar` gives an idea of the x-ray flux
  - `hfcond` returns a table of HF solar conditions
- Bulletin Board (BBS) functions
  - `bbshelp` returns the following
  - `bbslist` list the messages by ID and subject
  - `bbsread` read a message example use: `bbsread #1`
  - `bbspost` post a message example use: `bbspost $Message Subject #Message Body`
  - `bbsdelete` delete a message example use: `bbsdelete #4`
- Other functions
  - `whereami` returns the address of location of sender if known
  - `tide` returns the local tides, NOAA data source
  - `wx` and `wxc` returns local weather forecast, NOAA data source (wxc is metric value)
  - `wxa` and `wxalert` returns NOAA alerts. short title or expanded details
  - `joke` tells a joke
  - `messages` replays the last 5 messages approprate to permissions of channels

## Install
- Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/spudgunman/meshing-around`
- `install.sh` will automate optional venv and requirements install
- `launch.sh` will activate and launch the app in the venv if built

 ### Configurations
Some config is via code, converting to `config.ini` set the appropriate interface for your method (serial/ble/tcp). 
 Only one at a time is supported to a single node at a time.

```
#config.ini
# type can be serial, tcp, or ble
# port is the serial port to use, commented out will try to auto-detect
# hostname is the IP address of the device to connect to for tcp type
# mac is the MAC address of the device to connect to for ble type

[interface]
type = serial
# port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
# hostname = 192.168.0.1
# mac = 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

The following pair of settings determine how to respond, default action is to not spam the default channel. Setting DM_ONLY will force all DM which may not be wanted. Setting the Default channel is the channel which wont be spammed by the bot.
```
[general]
respond_by_dm_only = True
defaultChannel = 0
```

Modules can be disabled
```
[bbs]
enabled = False
```
