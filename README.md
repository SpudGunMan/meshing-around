## Key Features
![CodeQlBadge](https://github.com/SpudGunMan/meshing-around/actions/workflows/dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)

### Intelligent Keyword Responder
- **Automated Responses**: The bot detects keywords like "ping" and responds with "pong" in direct messages (DMs) or group channels.
- **Customizable Triggers**: Monitor group channels for specific keywords and set custom responses.
- **Localization Support**: Add custom trigger words in any language via `customPingWords` and `customTestWords` config options for international mesh networks.
- **Emergency Response**: Monitor channels for keywords indicating emergencies and alert a wider audience.
- **New Node Hello**: Greet new nodes on the mesh with a hello message

### User Statistics and Leaderboards
- **Activity Tracking**: Automatically tracks user statistics including message count, command usage, battery levels, and uptime.
- **Leaderboard Commands**: Use `top` or `leaderboard` to view rankings:
  - `top` or `top messages` - Most active message senders
  - `top commands` - Most command users
  - `top battery` - Lowest battery levels (most depleted)
  - `top online` - Most recently active users
  - `top 5` - Show top 5 instead of default 10
- **Competitive Engagement**: Encourage mesh network participation through friendly competition.

### Network Tools
- **Build, Test Local Mesh**: Ping allow for message delivery testing with more realistic packets vs. telemetry
- **Test Node Hardware**: `test` will send incremental sized data into the radio buffer for overall length of message testing
- **Network Monitoring**: Alert on noisy nodes, node locations, and best placment for relay nodes.

### Multi Radio/Node Support
- **Simultaneous Monitoring**: Monitor up to nine networks at the same time.
- **Flexible Messaging**: send mail and messages, between networks.

### Advanced Messaging Capabilities
- **Mail Messaging**: Leave messages for other devices, which are sent as DMs when the device is seen.
- **Scheduler**: Schedule messages like weather updates or reminders for weekly VHF nets.
- **Store and Forward**: Replay messages with the `messages` command, and log messages locally to disk.
- **Send Mail**: Send mail to nodes using `bbspost @nodeNumber #message` or `bbspost @nodeShortName #message`.
- **BBS Linking**: Combine multiple bots to expand BBS reach.
- **E-Mail/SMS**: Send mesh-messages to E-Mail or SMS(Email) expanding visibility.
- **New Node Hello**: Send a hello to any new node seen in text message.

### Interactive AI and Data Lookup
- **NOAA/USGS location Data**: Get localized weather(alerts), Earthquake, River Flow, and Tide information. Open-Meteo is used for wx only outside NOAA coverage. 
- **Wiki Integration**: Look up data using Wikipedia results.
- **Ollama LLM AI**: Interact with the [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs) LLM AI for advanced queries and responses.
- **Satellite Pass Info**: Get passes for satellite at your location.
- **GeoMeasuring**: HowFar from point to point using collected GPS packets on the bot to plot a course or space. Find Center of points for Fox&Hound direction finding.

### Proximity Alerts
- **Location-Based Alerts**: Get notified when members arrive back at a configured lat/long, perfect for remote locations like campsites.
- **High Flying Alerts**: Get notified when nodes with high altitude are seen on mesh

### CheckList / Check In Out

- **Scoring and Leaderboards**: Players can check their scores and see the top performers with `q: score` and `q: top`.
- **Easy Participation**: Players answer questions by prefixing their answer with `q:`, e.g., `q: 42`.

#### Survey Module
- **Custom Surveys**: Easily create and deploy custom surveys by editing JSON files in `data/survey`. Multiple surveys can be managed (e.g., `survey snow`).
- **User Feedback Collection**: Users can participate in surveys via DM, and responses are logged for later review.

### Radio Frequency Monitoring
- **SNR RF Activity Alerts**: Monitor a radio frequency and get alerts when high SNR RF activity is detected.
- **Hamlib Integration**: Use Hamlib (rigctld) to watch the S meter on a connected radio.

### EAS Alerts
- **FEMA iPAWS/EAS Alerts via API**: Use an internet-connected node to message Emergency Alerts from FEMA
- **NOAA EAS Alerts via API**: Use an internet-connected node to message Emergency Alerts from NOAA.
- **USGS Volcano Alerts via API**: Use an internet-connected node to message Emergency Alerts from USGS.
- **EAS Alerts over the air**: Utilizing external tools to report EAS alerts offline over mesh.
- **NINA alerts for Germany**: Emergency Alerts from xrepository.de feed

### File Monitor Alerts
- **File Monitor**: Monitor a flat/text file for changes, broadcast the contents of the message to the mesh channel.
- **News File**: On request of news, the contents of the file are returned. Can also call multiple news sources or files.
- **Shell Command Access**: Pass commands via DM directly to the host OS

### Data Reporting
- **HTML Generator**: Visualize bot traffic and data flows with a built-in HTML generator for [data reporting](logs/README.md).

### Robust Message Handling
- **Message Chunking**: Automatically chunk messages over 160 characters to ensure higher delivery success across hops.

## Getting Started
This project is developed on Linux (specifically a Raspberry Pi) but should work on any platform where the [Meshtastic protobuf API](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/python/cli/) modules are supported, and with any compatible [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/) hardware. For pico or low-powered devices, see projects for embedding, [buildroot](https://github.com/buildroot-meshtastic/buildroot-meshtastic), also see [femtofox](https://github.com/noon92/femtofox) for running on luckfox hardware. If you need a local console consider the [firefly](https://github.com/pdxlocations/firefly) project. ü•î Please use responsibly and follow local rulings for such equipment. This project captures packets, logs them, and handles over the air communications which can include PII such as GPS locations.

### Quick Setup 
#### Clone the Repository
If you dont have git you will need it `sudo apt-get install git`
```sh
git clone https://github.com/spudgunman/meshing-around
```
- **Automated Installation**: `install.sh` will automate optional venv and requirements installation.
- **Launch Script**: `launch.sh` only used in a venv install, to launch the bot and the report generator.

## Other Install Options

### Docker Installation - handy for windows
See further info on the [docker.md](script/docker/README.md)

### Manual Install
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the configuration template to `config.ini` and edit it to suit your needs:
```sh
cp config.template config.ini
```

### Configuration Guide
The following is documentation for the config.ini file

If you have not done so, or want to 'factory reset', copy the [config.template](config.template) to `config.ini` and set the appropriate interface for your method (serial/ble/tcp). While BLE and TCP will work, they are not as reliable as serial connections. There is a watchdog to reconnect TCP if possible. To get the BLE MAC address, use:
```sh
meshtastic --ble-scan
```

**Note**: The code has been tested with a single BLE device and is written to support only one BLE port.

```ini
# config.ini
# type can be serial, tcp, or ble.
# port is the serial port to use; commented out will try to auto-detect
# hostname is the IP address of the device to connect to for TCP type
# mac is the MAC address of the device to connect to for BLE type

[interface]
type = serial
# port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
# hostname = 192.168.0.1
# mac = 00:11:22:33:44:55

# Additional interface for dual radio support. See config.template for more.
[interface2]
enabled = False
```

### General Settings
The following settings determine how the bot responds. By default, the bot will not spam the default channel. Setting `respond_by_dm_only` to `True` will force all messages to be sent via DM, which may not be desired. Setting it to [`False`] will allow responses in the channel for all to see. If you have no default channel you can set this value to `-1` or any unused channel index. You can also have the bot ignore the defaultChannel for any commands, but still observe the channel.

```ini
[general]
respond_by_dm_only = True
defaultChannel = 0
ignoreDefaultChannel = False # ignoreDefaultChannel, the bot will ignore the default channel set above
ignoreChannels = # ignoreChannels is a comma separated list of channels to ignore, e.g. 4,5
cmdBang = False # require ! to be the first character in a command
explicitCmd = True # require explicit command, the message will only be processed if it starts with a command word disable to get more activity

# Custom trigger words for localization support
customPingWords = # comma-separated list of words that trigger ping response (e.g., hola,–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç,bonjour)
customTestWords = # comma-separated list of words that trigger test response (e.g., prueba,ÊµãËØï,testen)

# User statistics and leaderboard tracking
enableStatsTracking = True # enable tracking of user activity for leaderboard features
```

### Localization and Custom Trigger Words
The bot supports custom trigger words in any language, allowing international mesh networks to use familiar commands. Add comma-separated words to the config:

```ini
[general]
# Example: Add Spanish and Russian ping equivalents
customPingWords = hola,–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç,bonjour
# Example: Add Spanish and Chinese test equivalents  
customTestWords = prueba,ÊµãËØï,testen
```

These custom words will behave exactly like "ping" and "test" commands, responding with the same messages and metrics.

### User Statistics and Leaderboards
Enable activity tracking to create competitive engagement on your mesh network:

```ini
[general]
enableStatsTracking = True
```

Use the `top` command to view various leaderboards:
- `top` or `top messages` - See most active messagers
- `top commands` - View most command users
- `top battery` - Check who needs a charge (lowest battery)
- `top online` - See most recently active users
- `top 5` - Limit results to top 5 users

Statistics are automatically tracked for all users and persisted in `data/user_stats.json`.

### Location Settings
The weather forecasting defaults to NOAA, for locations outside the USA, you can set `UseMeteoWxAPI` to `True`, to use a global weather API. The `lat` and `lon` are default values when a node has no location data, as well as the default for all NOAA, repeater lookup. It is also the center of radius for Sentry.

```ini
[location]
enabled = True
lat = 48.50
lon = -123.0
UseMeteoWxAPI = True

coastalEnabled = False # NOAA Coastal Data Enable NOAA Coastal Waters Forecasts and Tide
# Find the correct coastal weather directory at https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/marine/coastal/
# this map can help https://www.weather.gov/marine select location and then look at the 'Forecast-by-Zone Map'
myCoastalZone = https://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/marine/coastal/pz/pzz135.txt # myCoastalZone is the .txt file with the forecast data
coastalForecastDays = 3 # number of data points to return, default is 3
```

### Module Settings
Modules can be enabled or disabled as needed. They are essentally larger functions of code which you may not want on your mesh or in memory space.

```ini
[bbs]
enabled = False

[general]
DadJokes = False
StoreForward = False
```

### History 
The history command shows the last commands the user ran, and [`lheard`] reflects the last users on the bot.

```ini
enableCmdHistory = True # history command enabler
lheardCmdIgnoreNodes = # command history ignore list ex: 2813308004,4258675309
```

### Sentry Settings

Sentry Bot detects anyone coming close to the bot-node. uses the Location Lat/Lon value.

```ini
SentryEnabled = True # detect anyone close to the bot
emailSentryAlerts = True # if SMTP enabled send alert to sysop email list
SentryRadius = 100 # radius in meters to detect someone close to the bot
SentryChannel = 9 # holdoff time multiplied by seconds(20) of the watchdog
SentryHoldoff = 2 # channel to send a message to when the watchdog is triggered
sentryIgnoreList = # list of ignored nodes numbers ex: 2813308004,4258675309
highFlyingAlert = True # HighFlying Node alert
highFlyingAlertAltitude = 2000 # Altitude in meters to trigger the alert
highflyOpenskynetwork = True # check with OpenSkyNetwork if highfly detected for aircraft
```

### E-Mail / SMS Settings
To enable connectivity with SMTP allows messages from meshtastic into SMTP. The term SMS here is for connection via [carrier email](https://avtech.com/articles/138/list-of-email-to-sms-addresses/)

```ini
[smtp]
# enable or disable the SMTP module, minimum required for outbound notifications
enableSMTP = True # enable or disable the IMAP module for inbound email, not implemented yet
enableImap = False # list of Sysop Emails separate with commas, used only in emergency responder currently
sysopEmails =
# See config.template for all the SMTP settings
SMTP_SERVER = smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_AUTH = True
EMAIL_SUBJECT = Meshtastic‚úâÔ∏è
```

### Emergency Response Handler
Traps the following ("emergency", "911", "112", "999", "police", "fire", "ambulance", "rescue") keywords. Responds to the user, and calls attention to the text message in logs and via another network or channel.

```ini
[emergencyHandler]
enabled = True # enable or disable the emergency response handler
alert_channel = 2 # channel to send a message to when the emergency handler is triggered
alert_interface = 1
```

### EAS Alerting
To Alert on Mesh with the EAS API you can set the channels and enable, checks every 20min.

#### FEMA iPAWS/EAS and NINA
This uses USA: SAME, FIPS, to locate the alerts in the feed. By default ignoring Test messages.

```ini
eAlertBroadcastEnabled = False # Goverment IPAWS/CAP Alert Broadcast
eAlertBroadcastCh = 2,3 # Goverment Emergency IPAWS/CAP Alert Broadcast Channels
ignoreFEMAenable = True # Ignore any headline that includes followig word list
ignoreFEMAwords = test,exercise
# comma separated list of FIPS codes to trigger local alert. find your FIPS codes at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code
myFIPSList = 57,58,53
# find your SAME https://www.weather.gov/nwr/counties comma separated list of SAME code to further refine local alert.
mySAMEList = 053029,053073

# To use other country services enable only a single optional serivce
enableDEalerts = False # Use DE Alert Broadcast Data see template for filters
myRegionalKeysDE = 110000000000,120510000000
```

#### NOAA EAS
 This uses the defined lat-long of the bot for collecting of data from the API. see [File-Monitoring](#File-Monitoring) for ideas to collect EAS alerts from a RTL-SDR.

```ini

wxAlertBroadcastEnabled = True # EAS Alert Broadcast 
wxAlertBroadcastCh = 2,4 # EAS Alert Broadcast Channels
ignoreEASenable = True # Ignore any headline that includes followig word list
ignoreEASwords = test,advisory
```

#### USGS River flow data and Volcano alerts
Using the USGS water data page locate a water flow device, for example Columbia River at Vancouver, WA - USGS-14144700

Volcano Alerts use lat/long to determine ~1000km radius
```ini
[location]
# USGS Hydrology unique identifiers, LID or USGS ID https://waterdata.usgs.gov
riverList = 14144700 # example Mouth of Columbia River

# USGS Volcano alerts Enable USGS Volcano Alert Broadcast
volcanoAlertBroadcastEnabled = False
volcanoAlertBroadcastCh = 2
```

### Repeater Settings
A repeater function for two different nodes and cross-posting messages. The `repeater_channels` is a list of repeater channels that will be consumed and rebroadcast on the same number channel on the other device, node, or interface. Each node should have matching channel numbers. The channel names and PSK do not need to be the same on the nodes. Use this feature responsibly to avoid creating a feedback loop.

```ini
[repeater] # repeater module
enabled = True
repeater_channels = [2, 3]
```

### Ollama (LLM/AI) Settings
For Ollama to work, the command line `ollama run 'model'` needs to work properly. Ensure you have enough RAM and your GPU is working as expected. The default model for this project is set to `gemma3:270m`. Ollama can be remote [Ollama Server](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) works on a pi58GB with 40 second or less response time.

```ini
# Enable ollama LLM see more at https://ollama.com
ollama = True # Ollama model to use (defaults to gemma2:2b)
ollamaModel = gemma3:latest # Ollama model to use (defaults to gemma3:270m)
ollamaHostName = http://localhost:11434 # server instance to use (defaults to local machine install)
```

Also see `llm.py` for changing the defaults of:

```ini
# LLM System Variables
rawQuery = True # if True, the input is sent raw to the LLM if False, it is processed by the meshBotAI template

# Used in the meshBotAI template (legacy)
llmEnableHistory = True # enable history for the LLM model to use in responses adds to compute time
llmContext_fromGoogle = True # enable context from google search results helps with responses accuracy
googleSearchResults = 3 # number of google search results to include in the context more results = more compute time
```
Note for LLM in docker with [NVIDIA](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/docker-specialized.html). Needed for the container with ollama running. 

### Radio Monitoring
A module allowing a Hamlib compatible radio to connect to the bot. When functioning, it will message the configured channel with a message of in use. **Requires hamlib/rigctld to be running as a service.**

```ini
[radioMon]
enabled = True
rigControlServerAddress = localhost:4532
sigWatchBroadcastCh = 2 # channel to broadcast to can be 2,3
signalDetectionThreshold = -10 # minimum SNR as reported by radio via hamlib
signalHoldTime = 10 # hold time for high SNR
signalCooldown = 5 # the following are combined to reset the monitor
signalCycleLimit = 5
```

### File Monitoring
Some dev notes for ideas of use

```ini
[fileMon]
filemon_enabled = True
file_path = alert.txt # text file to monitor for changes
broadcastCh = 2 # channel to send the message to can be 2,3 multiple channels comma separated
enable_read_news = False # news  command will return the contents of a text file
news_file_path = news.txt
news_random_line = False # only return a single random line from the news file
enable_runShellCmd = False # enable the use of exernal shell commands, this enables some data in `sysinfo`
# if runShellCmd and you think it is safe to allow the x: command to run
# direct shell command handler the x: command in DMs user must be in bbs_admin_list
allowXcmd = True
```

#### Offline EAS

To Monitor EAS with no internet connection see the following notes
- [samedec](https://crates.io/crates/samedec) rust decoder much like multimon-ng
  - [sameold](https://crates.io/crates/sameold) rust SAME message translator much like EAS2Text and dsame3

no examples yet for these tools

- [EAS2Text](https://github.com/A-c0rN/EAS2Text)
  - depends on [multimon-ng](https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng), [direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf), [samedec](https://crates.io/crates/samedec) rust decoder much like multimon-ng
- [dsame3](https://github.com/jamieden/dsame3)
  - has a sample .ogg file for testing alerts

The following example shell command can pipe the data using [etc/eas_alert_parser.py](etc/eas_alert_parser.py) to alert.txt
```bash
sox -t ogg WXR-RWT.ogg -esigned-integer -b16 -r 22050 -t raw - | multimon-ng -a EAS -v 1 -t raw - | python eas_alert_parser.py
```
The following example shell command will pipe rtl_sdr to alert.txt
```bash
rtl_fm -f 162425000 -s 22050 | multimon-ng -t raw -a EAS /dev/stdin | python eas_alert_parser.py
```

#### Newspaper on mesh
Maintain multiple news sources. Each source should be a file named `{source}_news.txt` in the `data/` directory (for example, `data/mesh_news.txt`).
- To read the default news, use the `readnews` command (reads from `data/news.txt`.
- To read a specific source, use `readnews abc` to read from `data/abc_news.txt`.

This allows you to organize and access different news feeds or categories easily.  
External scripts can update these files as needed, and the bot will serve the latest content on request.

### Greet new nodes QRZ module
This isnt QRZ.com this is Q code for who is calling me, this will track new nodes and say hello
```ini
[qrz] 
enabled = True # QRZ Hello to new nodes
qrz_hello_string = "send CMD or DM me for more info." # will be sent to all heard nodes once
training = True # Training mode will not send the hello message to new nodes, use this to build up database
```

### Scheduler
In the config.ini enable the module
```ini
[scheduler]
enabled = False # enable or disable the scheduler module
interface = 1 # channel to send the message to
channel = 2
message = "MeshBot says Hello! DM for more info."
value = # value can be min,hour,day,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat,sun
interval =  # interval to use when time is not set (e.g. every 2 days)
time = # time of day in 24:00 hour format when value is 'day' and interval is not set
```
 The basic brodcast message can be setup in condig.ini. For advanced, See mesh_bot.py around the bottom of file, line [1491](https://github.com/SpudGunMan/meshing-around/blob/e94581936530c76ea43500eebb43f32ba7ed5e19/mesh_bot.py#L1491) to edit the schedule. See [schedule documentation](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more. Recomend to backup changes so they dont get lost.

```python
#Send WX every Morning at 08:00 using handle_wxc function to channel 2 on device 1
schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(lambda: send_message(handle_wxc(0, 1, 'wx'), 2, 0, 1))

#Send a Net Starting Now Message Every Wednesday at 19:00 using send_message function to channel 2 on device 1
schedule.every().wednesday.at("19:00").do(lambda: send_message("Net Starting Now", 2, 0, 1))
```

#### BBS Link
The scheduler also handles the BBS Link Broadcast message, this would be an example of a mesh-admin channel on 8 being used to pass BBS post traffic between two bots as the initiator, one direction pull.
```python
# Send bbslink looking for peers every other day at 10:00 using send_message function to channel 8 on device 1
schedule.every(2).days.at("10:00").do(lambda: send_message("bbslink MeshBot looking for peers", 8, 0, 1))
```
```ini
bbslink_enabled = True
bbslink_whitelist = # list of whitelisted nodes numbers ex: 2813308004,4258675309 empty list allows all
```

### Firmware 2.6 DM Key, and 2.7 CLIENT_BASE Favorite Nodes
Firmware 2.6 introduced [PKC](https://meshtastic.org/blog/introducing-new-public-key-cryptography-in-v2_5/), enabling secure private messaging by adding necessary keys to each node. To fully utilize this feature, you should add favorite nodes‚Äîsuch as BBS admins‚Äîto your node‚Äôs favorites list to ensure their keys are retained. A helper script is provided to simplify this process:
- Run the helper script from the main program directory: `python3 script/addFav.py`
- By default, this script adds nodes from `bbs_admin_list` and `bbslink_whitelist`
- If using a virtual environment, run: `launch.sh addfav`

To configure favorite nodes, add their numbers to your config file:
```conf
[general]
favoriteNodeList = # list of favorite nodes numbers ex: 2813308004,4258675309 used by script/addFav.py
```

### MQTT Notes
There is no direct support for MQTT in the code, however, reports from Discord are that using [meshtasticd](https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/linux-native-hardware/) with no radio and attaching the bot to the software node, which is MQTT-linked, allows routing. Tested working fully Firmware:2.6.11 with [mosquitto](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/integrations/mqtt/mosquitto/).

~~There also seems to be a quicker way to enable MQTT by having your bot node with the enabled [serial](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/module/serial/) module with echo enabled and MQTT uplink and downlink. These two~~
