# Implementation Summary: Custom Trigger Words & User Statistics

## Features Implemented

### 1. Custom Trigger Words (Variable Trigger / Localization)
✅ **Complete** - Addresses requirement #1 from the issue

**What was implemented:**
- Configuration options `customPingWords` and `customTestWords` in config.ini
- Support for any language or custom words (e.g., "hola", "привет", "测试")
- Dynamic addition to trap_list and command handlers
- Seamless integration with existing ping/test handling
- Works in both mesh_bot.py and pong_bot.py

**How it works:**
1. User adds custom words to config.ini (comma-separated)
2. Bot loads words during initialization
3. Words are added to trap_list for message filtering
4. Words trigger same responses as built-in "ping"/"test"
5. Supports multi-language mesh networks

**Example configuration:**
```ini
[general]
customPingWords = hola,bonjour,привет,ciao
customTestWords = prueba,testen,测试,テスト
```

### 2. User Statistics & Leaderboards (Top/Competitive Feature)
✅ **Complete** - Addresses requirement #2 from the issue

**What was implemented:**
- Automatic tracking of user statistics:
  - Message count
  - Command usage
  - Battery levels (from telemetry)
  - Uptime (from telemetry)
  - First/last seen timestamps
- New `top` and `leaderboard` commands
- Multiple leaderboard types:
  - `top messages` - Most active messagers
  - `top commands` - Most command users
  - `top battery` - Lowest battery (most depleted)
  - `top online` - Most recently active
  - Configurable limits (e.g., `top 5`)
- Persistent storage in data/user_stats.json
- Automatic cleanup and saving

**Example usage:**
```
User: top
Bot: 🏆 Most Messages:
1. KC7MHI: 142
2. KB7YEG: 98
3. KF7XYZ: 76

User: top battery 3
Bot: 🏆 Lowest Battery (3):
1. KC7MHI: 15%
2. N7ABC: 28%
3. KB7YEG: 45%
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **modules/stats.py** - Statistics tracking and leaderboard module
2. **data/trigger_words.json** - Example localization file
3. **FEATURE_CUSTOM_WORDS_STATS.md** - Feature documentation
4. **test_features.py** - Test script for validation

### Modified Files:
1. **config.template** - Added config options
2. **modules/settings.py** - Load config values
3. **modules/system.py** - Integrate custom words and stats saving
4. **mesh_bot.py** - Add custom word support, top command, stats tracking
5. **pong_bot.py** - Add custom word support
6. **README.md** - Documentation and command table
7. **.gitignore** - Exclude user_stats.json

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions:
1. **Modular Design**: Stats tracking is in separate module for maintainability
2. **Minimal Changes**: Surgical edits to existing code paths
3. **Backwards Compatible**: All features are opt-in via config
4. **Persistent Storage**: JSON format for easy inspection/backup
5. **Performance**: Efficient O(1) lookups, periodic saves

### Statistics Tracking Points:
- **Messages**: Tracked in TEXT_MESSAGE_APP handler (onReceive)
- **Commands**: Tracked in auto_response after command execution
- **Telemetry**: Tracked in consumeMetadata (battery, uptime)
- **Persistence**: Saved during cleanup_memory cycle

### Custom Words Integration:
- Added to trap_list during system initialization
- Dynamically added to command_handler dictionaries
- Checked in handle_ping() alongside built-in words
- Case-insensitive matching

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`test_features.py`) that validates:
- ✅ Statistics tracking (messages, commands, battery, uptime)
- ✅ Leaderboard generation for all types
- ✅ Custom trigger word matching
- ✅ Data persistence to JSON
- ✅ No syntax errors in modified files

All tests pass successfully.

## Configuration Example

```ini
[general]
# Enable features
enableStatsTracking = True

# Custom trigger words (comma-separated)
customPingWords = hola,bonjour,привет,ciao,cześć
customTestWords = prueba,testen,测试,テスト,проверка

# Existing settings...
respond_by_dm_only = True
defaultChannel = 0
```

## Usage Examples

### Custom Words (Localization)
```
Spanish user: "hola"
Bot: "🏓PONG\nSNR:8.5 RSSI:-95"

Russian user: "привет"
Bot: "🏓PONG\nDirect"

Chinese user: "测试 3"
Bot: "🎙Testing 1,2,3\nSNR:7.2 RSSI:-98"
```

### Leaderboards (Competition)
```
User: "top"
Bot: Shows top 10 message senders

User: "top commands 5"
Bot: Shows top 5 command users

User: "top battery"
Bot: Shows users with lowest battery (needs charging)

User: "top online"
Bot: Shows most recently active users

User: "top?"
Bot: Shows help message
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential additions that could be made:
- Time-based leaderboards (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Team/group statistics
- Achievement system (badges for milestones)
- Export to HTML report
- Load trigger words from JSON file
- Per-node custom responses
- Integration with quiz game scoring

## Compatibility

- ✅ Works with existing mesh_bot.py functionality
- ✅ Works with existing pong_bot.py functionality
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing features
- ✅ Backwards compatible (features are opt-in)
- ✅ No new dependencies required

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: O(1) dictionary lookups
- Periodic saves (not per-message)
- Memory efficient: Cleanup old entries
- No impact when features disabled

## Documentation

Complete documentation provided:
- ✅ README.md updated with features
- ✅ Command table updated
- ✅ Configuration examples
- ✅ FEATURE_CUSTOM_WORDS_STATS.md detailed guide
- ✅ Inline code comments
- ✅ Test script with examples

## Conclusion

Both requested features have been successfully implemented with:
- Clean, maintainable code
- Comprehensive documentation
- Full testing and validation
- No breaking changes
- Easy to configure and use

The implementation follows the repository's coding style and maintains high readability for end users as requested.
