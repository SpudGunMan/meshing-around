# Blackjack Game Module

This module implements a classic game of Blackjack (Casino 21) for the Meshtastic mesh-bot.

## How to Play

- **Start the Game:**  
  Send the command `blackjack` via DM to the bot to start a new game session.
- **Place a Bet:**  
  When prompted, enter the amount you wish to wager (e.g., `5`). Minimum bet is 1 chip, maximum is your current chip total.
- **Gameplay Commands:**  
  After betting, you will be dealt two cards. The dealer will also have two cards (one face up).
  - `h` or `hit` — Draw another card.
  - `s` or `stand` — End your turn and let the dealer play.
  - `d` or `double` — Double your bet and draw one more card (if you have enough chips).
  - `f` or `forfit` — Forfeit half your bet and end the round.
  - `r` or `resend` — Resend your current hand status.
  - `l` or `leave` — Leave the table and end your session.

- **Winning:**  
  - Get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
  - If your hand exceeds 21, you bust and lose your bet.
  - If you beat the dealer without busting, you win your bet.
  - If you get a Blackjack (21 with two cards), you win 1.5x your bet.
  - If you tie the dealer, it's a push (no win/loss).

- **High Scores:**  
  The module tracks the highest chip total achieved. If you beat the high score, you'll be notified!

## Notes

- Each player starts with 100 chips.
- If you run out of chips, your balance will reset to 100.
- The game state is tracked per player using your node ID.
- Game progress and high scores are saved in `data/blackjack_hs.pkl`.
- Only one game session per player is supported at a time.

# PyGame Help

'pygame - Community Edition' ('pygame-ce' for short) is a fork of the original 'pygame' library by former 'pygame' core contributors.

It offers many new features and optimizations, receives much better maintenance and runs under a better governance model, while being highly compatible with code written for upstream pygame (`import pygame` still works).

**Details**
- [Initial announcement on Reddit](<https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/1112q10/pygame_community_edition_announcement/>) (or https://discord.com/channels/772505616680878080/772506385304649738/1074593440148500540)
- [Why the forking happened](<https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/18xy7nf/what_was_the_disagreement_that_led_to_pygamece/>)

**Helpful Links**

- [Our GitHub releases](<https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/releases>)
- [Our docs](https://pyga.me/docs/)

**Installation**
```sh
pip uninstall pygame # Uninstall pygame first since it would conflict with pygame-ce
pip install pygame-ce
```
-# Because 'pygame' installs to the same location as 'pygame-ce', it must first be uninstalled.
-# Note that the `import pygame` syntax has not changed with pygame-ce.

# mUDP Help

mUDP library provides UDP-based broadcasting of Meshtastic-compatible packets. MeshBot uses this for the game_server_display server.
