checklist_db = data/checklist.db
# Set to True to reverse the meaning of checkin/checkout
reverse_in_out = False
```

## Commands Reference

### Basic Commands

#### Check In
```
checkin [interval] [notes]
```

Check in to the system. Optionally specify a monitoring interval in minutes.

**Examples:**

purgein    # Delete your check-in record
purgeout   # Delete your check-out record
```

Use these to manually remove your records if needed.

### Admin Commands

#### Approve Check-in
```
checklistapprove <checkin_id>
```

Approve a pending check-in (requires admin privileges).

**Example:**
```
checklistapprove 123
```

#### Deny Check-in
```
checklistdeny <checkin_id>
```

Deny and remove a check-in (requires admin privileges).

**Example:**

```

## Safety Monitoring Feature

### How Time Intervals Work

When checking in with an interval parameter, the system will track whether you check in again or check out within that timeframe.

```
checkin 60 Hunting in remote area
```

This tells the system:
- You're checking in now
- You expect to check in again or check out within 60 minutes
- If 60 minutes pass without activity, you'll be marked as overdue

### Use Cases for Time Intervals

1. **Solo Activities**: Hunting, hiking, or working alone
   ```
   checkin 30 Solo patrol north sector
   ```

2. **High-Risk Operations**: Tree work, equipment maintenance
   ```
   checkin 45 Climbing tower for antenna work
   ```

3. **Remote Work**: Working in isolated areas
   ```
   checkin 120 Survey work in remote canyon
   ```

4. **Check-in Points**: Regular status updates during long operations
   ```
   checkin 15 Descending cliff face
   ```

### Overdue Check-ins

The system tracks all check-ins with time intervals and can identify who is overdue. The module provides the `get_overdue_checkins()` function that returns a list of overdue users. 

**Note**: Automatic alerts for overdue check-ins require integration with the bot's scheduler or alert system. The checklist module provides the detection capability, but sending notifications must be configured separately through the main bot's alert features.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Hunting Scenario

Hunter checks in before going into the field:
```
checkin 60 Hunting deer stand #3, north 40
```

System response:
```
Checked‚úÖIn: Hunter1 (monitoring every 60min)
```

If the hunter doesn't check out or check in again within 60 minutes, they will appear on the overdue list.

When done hunting:
```
checkout Heading back to camp
```

System response:
```
Checked‚åõÔ∏èOut: Hunter1 duration 02:15:30
```

### Example 2: Emergency Response Team

Team leader tracks team members:

```
# Team members check in
checkin 30 Search grid A-1
checkin 30 Search grid A-2
checkin 30 Search grid A-3
```

Team leader views status:
```
checklist
```

Response shows all active searchers with their durations.

### Example 3: Equipment Checkout

Track equipment loans:

```
checkin Radio #5 for field ops
```

When equipment is returned:
```
checkout Equipment returned
```

### Example 4: Site Survey

Field technicians checking in at locations:

```
# At first site
checkin 45 Site survey tower location 1

# Moving to next site (automatically checks out from first)
checkin 45 Site survey tower location 2
```

## Integration with Other Systems

### Geo-Location Awareness

The checklist system automatically captures GPS coordinates when available. This can be used for:
- Tracking last known position
- Geo-fencing applications
- Emergency response coordination
- Asset location management

### Alert Systems

The overdue check-in feature can trigger:
- Notifications to supervisors
- Emergency alerts
- Automated messages to response teams
- Email/SMS notifications (if configured)

### Scheduling Integration

Combine with the scheduler module to:
- Send reminders to check in
- Automatically generate reports
- Schedule periodic check-in requirements
- Send daily summaries

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Always Include Context**: Add notes when checking in
   ```
   checkin 30 North trail maintenance
   ```
   Not just:
   ```
   checkin
   ```

2. **Set Realistic Intervals**: Don't set intervals too short or too long
   - Too short: False alarms
   - Too long: Defeats safety purpose

3. **Check Out Promptly**: Always check out when done to clear your status

4. **Use Consistent Naming**: If tracking equipment, use consistent names

### For Administrators

1. **Review Checklist Regularly**: Monitor who is checked in
   ```
   checklist
   ```

2. **Respond to Overdue Situations**: Act on overdue check-ins promptly

3. **Set Clear Policies**: Establish when and how to use the system

4. **Train Users**: Ensure everyone knows how to use time intervals

5. **Test the System**: Regularly verify the system is working

## Safety Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Tree Stand Hunting
```
checkin 60 Hunting from tree stand at north plot
```
If hunter falls or has medical emergency, they'll be marked overdue after 60 minutes.

### Scenario 2: Equipment Maintenance
```
checkin 30 Generator maintenance at remote site
```
If technician encounters danger, overdue status can be detected. Note: Requires alert system integration to send notifications.

### Scenario 3: Hiking
```
checkin 120 Day hike to mountain peak
```
Longer interval for extended activity, but still provides safety net.

### Scenario 4: Watchstanding
```
checkin 240 Night watch duty
```
Regular check-ins every 4 hours ensure person is alert and safe.

## Database Schema

### checkin Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE checkin (
    checkin_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    checkin_name TEXT,
    checkin_date TEXT,
    checkin_time TEXT,
    location TEXT,
    checkin_notes TEXT,
    approved INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    expected_checkin_interval INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)
```

### checkout Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE checkout (
    checkout_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    checkout_name TEXT,
    checkout_date TEXT,
    checkout_time TEXT,
    location TEXT,
    checkout_notes TEXT
)
```

## Reverse Mode

Setting `reverse_in_out = True` in config swaps the meaning of checkin and checkout commands. This is useful if your organization uses opposite terminology.

With `reverse_in_out = True`:
- `checkout` command performs a check-in
- `checkin` command performs a check-out

## Migration from Basic Checklist

The enhanced checklist is backward compatible with the basic version. Existing check-ins will continue to work, and new features are optional. The database will automatically upgrade to add new columns when first accessed.

## Troubleshooting

### Not Seeing Overdue Alerts
The overdue detection is built into the module, but alerts need to be configured in the main bot scheduler. Check your scheduler configuration.

### Wrong Duration Shown
Duration is calculated from check-in time to current time. If system clock is wrong, durations will be incorrect. Ensure system time is accurate.

### Can't Approve/Deny Check-ins
These are admin-only commands. Check that your node ID is in the `bbs_admin_list`.

### Location Not Showing
GPS coordinates are only captured if the node has GPS enabled and has a fix. Check node GPS settings.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- Configurable alert thresholds per user
- Email/SMS notifications for overdue check-ins
- Historical check-in reports
- Check-in schedules and recurring events
- Geo-fence monitoring
- Integration with tracking systems
- Mobile app support
