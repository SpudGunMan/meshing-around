# Logs and Reports

This directory stores log files generated by the Mesh Bot. To generate useful reports, ensure you have at least a day's worth of logs or a substantial number of messages.

## Reporting

Reports are generated using [`../etc/report_generator5.py`](../etc/report_generator5.py), which produces modern HTML5 reports. The output (`index.html`) is saved in [`../etc/www`](../etc/www) by default. A `.cfg` configuration file is created on first run, allowing you to customize settings such as the web root directory.

- Ensure `SyslogToFile = True` and `sysloglevel = DEBUG` in your configuration to enable full reporting.
- If using a virtual environment and `launch.sh`, you can run:  
  ```sh
  launch.sh html5
  ```

## Settings
Logging messages to disk or 'Syslog' to disk uses the python native logging function.
```conf
[general]
# logging to file of the non Bot messages only
LogMessagesToFile = False
# Logging of system messages to file, needed for reporting engine
SyslogToFile = True
# logging level for the bot (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
sysloglevel = DEBUG
# Number of log files to keep in days, 0 to keep all
log_backup_count = 32
```
## Web Reporting WebServer
There is a web-server module. You can run `python3 modules/web.py` from the project root directory and it will serve up the web content.

find it at. http://localhost:8420

If you have linux-native running and errors such as..
```bash
  File "/usr/lib/python3.11/http/server.py", line 136, in server_bind
    socketserver.TCPServer.server_bind(self)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.11/socketserver.py", line 472, in server_bind
    self.socket.bind(self.server_address)
```
modify the modules/web.py to use a real IP address, meshtasticD-native is binding to 127.0.0.1

```python
# Set the desired IP address
server_ip = '127.0.0.1'
```
